        <p>
        I am a prospective computer science major/biology minor at Caltech with software development and research experience. I enjoy learning new subjects or skills and strive for a deep understanding of the areas I am passionate about.

         I am currently looking for jobs after I graduate in June 2023, where I can apply my knowledge of software development, algorithms, computer systems, machine learning, and/or computational biology to research solutions and/or build products that improve peopleâ€™s lives.
