             I am a prospective computer science major/biology minor at Caltech with skills in software engineering and a love of problem-solving. I love solving problems in general, especially those that are helpful to society, as well as learning new subjects or skills. I strive for deep understanding of the subjects I am passionate about.

             I am currently looking for jobs after I graduate in June 2023, where I can apply my knowledge of software development, algorithms, computer systems, machine learning, and/or computational biology to research solutions and/or build products that improve peopleâ€™s lives.
